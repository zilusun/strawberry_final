The bar chart titled "Impact of Chemicals on Strawberry Yield by Year (California, 2018-2023)" illustrates the total strawberry yield in California under the effects of different chemical treatments (as indicated in the name column) for the years 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2023. The name column specifies four categories of chemicals: fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, and other. According to the chart, fungicide is the most commonly used chemical in strawberry production, and its application has the most significant impact on strawberry yields. Areas that only use fungicides reached peak strawberry yields in 2019, followed by a decline, with yields stabilizing in 2021 and 2023.

The influence of insecticides on strawberry yields shows some fluctuations, but their use also had a considerable impact on yields in 2019. Among the three types of chemicals, areas that only use herbicides exhibited relatively lower strawberry yields but showed a clear upward trend during the assessed years.

Analysis: Fungicide is the most commonly used chemical in strawberry production in California, likely because strawberries are highly susceptible to fungal diseases, which can significantly reduce yield and fruit quality. California's climate, particularly in coastal regions, creates favorable conditions for fungal growth. Therefore, farmers heavily rely on fungicides to protect their crops and ensure consistent yields.

As for herbicides, the increasing yields in areas using herbicides could be attributed to improved weed management over time. Weeds compete with strawberry plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight, so effective weed control helps maximize plant health and fruit production. The rising yields in these areas may indicate that farmers are adopting better weed control practices, contributing to improved overall strawberry production.

 The chart titled "Total Value of Top 4 Chemicals by Year (2018-2023)" is a bar graph that uses the code column to illustrate the total strawberry yield for the four chemicals with the highest production volumes between 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2023. SULFUR = 77501 and THIRAM = 79801 have the broadest usage, being utilized in all evaluation years. Both chemicals show a trend of increasing use over the evaluation years, which is also evident from the line graph titled "Yearly Strawberry Yield Changes by Chemical (2018-2023)."
 
 The larger standard deviations for DICHLOROPROPENE and SULFUR indicate that the yield of these chemicals fluctuated more significantly across different years. In contrast, other chemicals like CAPTAN and THIRAM show smaller standard deviations, suggesting that their yields were relatively stable.

Analysis:
Sulfur has inhibitory effects on various fungal diseases, particularly effective in controlling powdery mildew and rust diseases. It can also suppress the breeding of certain pests, playing a vital role in integrated pest management for crops.

As a natural mineral source, sulfur has low toxicity and is relatively environmentally friendly, making it widely used for disease prevention in various crops such as strawberries, grapes, and vegetables. In strawberry cultivation, sulfur is primarily used to prevent powdery mildew and other fungal diseases, ensuring the healthy growth of the crops and increasing yields. Due to its efficacy, low toxicity, and easy availability, sulfur holds a significant position in the cultivation of strawberries and other crops.

Thiram, like sulfur, is commonly used to control gray mold and anthracnose diseases caused by fungi. It works by disrupting the metabolic processes of pathogens to protect crops. Farmers regard Thiram as a reliable broad-spectrum fungicide suitable for disease management under various climatic and environmental conditions.

However, due to its certain toxicity, long-term exposure to Thiram can adversely affect the environment and human health. Therefore, its use is strictly regulated in modern agriculture, especially in organic and environmentally friendly farming practices, where the application of Thiram may face certain restrictions.

Dichloropropene and CAPTAN have not been used as widely as the first two chemicals. Although these chemicals are effective for strawberry cultivation, they also pose risks to human health and the environment. The non-use of these chemicals in strawberry fields in 2023 may be related to regulatory restrictions, the adoption of alternatives, crop management strategies, or changes in environmental conditions.

Compared to California, Florida shows a greater variety of chemical types used in strawberry production, with a stronger reliance on fungicides and less dependence on other chemical agents.

Analysis: The strawberry farming in Florida faces different threats from pests and diseases, which may necessitate the use of fungicides to combat fungal-related diseases. This makes fungicides a preferred control method. In contrast, California's climate and soil conditions may lead to different pest and disease challenges, prompting farmers to choose other types of chemical agents, such as insecticides and herbicides, to address specific pest and weed issues.

Unlike California, strawberry cultivation in Florida relies heavily on CAPTAN (81301) and THIRAM (79801), while California uses a wider variety of chemicals.
The larger standard deviations for CAPTAN and THIRAM, shown by the longer black lines, indicate that the yields of these chemicals fluctuated more significantly across the years. In contrast, CYPRODINIL and FLUDIOXONIL have smaller standard deviations, with shorter black lines, suggesting that their yields were relatively stable with less variation between years.

Analysis:
Florida's climate is relatively humid, which is conducive to the growth of fungi, particularly common strawberry diseases such as gray mold and powdery mildew. In such an environment, farmers are more inclined to use effective fungicides like CAPTAN and THIRAM to control diseases and ensure yield. Additionally, compared to California's strawberry production, Florida's overall strawberry acreage is smaller, leading farmers to be less concerned about the potential environmental impact of large-scale CAPTAN and THIRAM usage.
